========================================================Evidence Srl, Code generator for the FLEX and EASYLAB boards========================================================A short description of the files and the folders contained in the 'dspic' directory:Flex-Roller      This folder contains the dynamic-link library (RollerGui.dll) for the roller-GUI     used by the block "ROLLER GUI" in the FLEX-PC palette.Flex-UDP    This folder contains the dynamic-link library (libFlexUDPComms.dll) used by the UDP blocks     in the FLEX-PC palette.NativeInteger      This folder contains the dynamic-link library (libnativeinteger.dll) used by the gain     and summation blocks in the MCHP16-Linear palette.Flex-Sim         This folder contains the dynamic-link library (libflexsim.dll) used for the simualtion    of the FLEX blocks .dynmem_blocks               This is a list of dynamic-memory based blocks. The file is interpreted by the     EE_get_diagram_info.sci script.symbols    This file specifies the symbols that every block should define in the first step of the    code generation.builder.sce        This file is used by the installer.sce to build the interfacing functions of the blocks. loader.sce    This file is used by the .scilab script (in the SCIHOME folder) to load the blocks.flash.bat, flash.sh                    These files are used to program, in release mode, the dsPIC33FJ256MC710 microcontroller of the FLEX board using    the pic30.cof executable generated after the compiling step.  work_blocks         This file contains a list of blocks to be treated in a specific way.compile.bat, compile.sh      These files are copied in the project directory and are used to build the project. macros    This is the folder that contains the Code-Generator scripts, the blocks and the palettes.functions_dependencies      This file contains a list of dependencies to be treated during the code generation step.
