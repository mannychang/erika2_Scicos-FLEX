This folder contains the project to build the dynamic library "libFlexUDPComms.dll" used 
by the blocks located in the "RT-Data-Exchange" palette folder. The dynamic library can be 
linked using the following commands:

cd("<path_to_the_folder>");
exec loader.sce

Please note this command is already in the .scilab file distributed
in the scicos pack (refer "user" folder)
