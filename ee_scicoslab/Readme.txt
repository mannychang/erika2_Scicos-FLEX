- Getting Started

1.    Download and install Cygwin from the Cygwin site 
      (http://www.cygwin.com/)
      Cygwin is required to compile the code generated from your Scicos diagram.

2.    Download and install Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 from the Microsoft Visual C++ site 
      (http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/#2008-Visual-CPP)
      It is required from the Evidence Scicoslab pack.

3.    Download and install ScicosLab 4.4.1 from the ScicosLab site 
      (http://erika.tuxfamily.org/scilabscicos.html) 

4.    Download and install  Microchip MPLAB IDE from the MPLAB IDE site
      (http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=1406&dDocName=en019469)
      It is required to program the dsPIC microcontroller mounted on the FLEX board. 
      Then download and install a C30 compiler, for example from the Microchip MPLAB C30 compiler site
      (http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=1406&dDocName=en010065&part=SW006012)
      A compiler is required to compile your projects. 
      To program the dsPIC microcontroller you need a programmer. 
      You can buy a programmer for dsPIC from Microchip site. 
      Programmers suggested are: Microchip MPLAB ICD2 or Microchip MPLAB ICD3. 
      See the Microchip site for more informations: 
      http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=1406&dDocName=en010046
      
5.    Download the latest Scicoslab pack from the ScicosLab pack download page
      (http://erika.tuxfamily.org/scilabscicos.html) 
      Unzip the pack and install it with the following procedure. 


- Installation

      To install the pack execute the 'installer.sce' script into ScicosLab (File -> Exec...). 
      (If needed, run ScicosLab with ADMINISTRATOR privileges. It is required if the Scicoslab main directory
      is in a protected path).
      At the end of the installation restart ScicosLab for the changes to take effect.
      Create and compile your first Scicos diagram as shown here: 
      http://erika.tuxfamily.org/wiki/index.php?title=Amazing_Ball_Control_System:_An_example_of_PID_control_and_UDP_communication 
      Then flash the microcontroller, test your application and ... have fun!

Please note, this version of the ScicosLab pack includes a stand-alone version of RT-Druid 
and a full version of Erika Enterprise to simplify the installation procedure.
