This demo is an example of a distributed system among different nodes and differente communication channel.

- The first node is a Flex board acquiring and displaying data. Some of these data are transmitted to the second node using a 802.15.4 transceiver;
- The second node is a Flex board mixing data acquired locally with received data. Some results are shown while others are transmitted through the USB to a PC;
- The third node is a PC, running a Scilab/Scicos schematic, which is in charge of receiving data from the USB and to display them on scopes.
