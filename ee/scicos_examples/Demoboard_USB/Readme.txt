This demo is an example of a distributed system among different nodes connected through USB.

- The first node is an application generated by Scilab/Scicos which acquires data from sensors, it performs elaborations then shows data locally. Some of the output informations are sent to a PC using the USB interface.
- The second node is a PC, running a Scilab/Scicos schematic, which is in charge of receiving data from the USB and display them on scopes.
