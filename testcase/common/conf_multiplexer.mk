# CONF multiplexer
include ../$(EXPERIMENT)/conf.in


# PURPOSE OF THIS MAKEFILE
# This makefile is called by the ARCH multiplexer, once for each
# architecture that have to be tested for a particular EXPERIMENT
# directory
#
# This makefile uses the macros defined in the $(thearch)/arch.mk
# makefile on a custom directory to handle compilation and testing of
# the particular EXPERIMENT for the particular $(theconf)iguration.

# variables defined from now on:
# all the variables described in arch_multiplexer.mk plus:
# from arch_multiplexer.mk
# - thearch    the architecture I am testing (e.g., ee_manual)

#
# Note for writing an arch.mk file:
#
# ARCH_OUTDIR_COMMANDS is the only ARCH_* macro that is NOT called
# inside a template!!!!
#
# PARAMETERS is used inside a template BUT IT DOES NOT NEED A $$, only a $
