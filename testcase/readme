ScicosLab testcases
---------------------------------------------------

This testcase will compile all the ScicosLab tests
for all the configuration with a name starting with
a given prefix.

usage:

make ARCH=prefix
make ARCH=prefix DIRS=<list of examples' dirs you want to test>
make clean
make supported ARCH=prefix

---

To get a list of which palettes are used in each
available diagram:

make analyze ARCH=flex 

---

where 

- "DIRS" are the list of examples you want to test
- "DISTCC=distcc" if not set in your bash_profile, 
  allows to run tests using distcc

- "prefix" is one of:

  - "flex" - ScicosLab FLEX codegen
  ... and others

- the "clean" rule removes all the */out* directories

- the "supported" rule prints for each testcase if the particular ARCHitecture
  is supported

Examples:

make analyze ARCH=flex
